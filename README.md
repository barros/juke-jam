# Juke Jam

#### _Coming soon to the App Store!_

Juke Jam was created as a way to allow users to accept song requests to their Apple Music library playlists. Playlist lobbies and song requests are stored using a PostgreSQL database. After the user has created a playlist lobby ('Sharing' on iOS, "Create a New Lobby" on web), a playlist begins accepting requests from guests who have accessed the lobby through a shared link. A guest can browse the Apple Music catalog, find a song they want added to the queue, and request it.

This iOS project was developed in collaboration with the Juke Jam website (which will sync and work with the same database when released on the App Store).
